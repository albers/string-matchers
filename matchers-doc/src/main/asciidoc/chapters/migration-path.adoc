## Migration Path

We will document our migration path through a variety of tiny steps until we have a fully modularized Java 9 application that leverages the features introduced with Jigsaw.

1. Switch to language level *Java 9* in both the IDE (IntelliJ IDEA 17.2) as well as setting the source and target language level to Java 9 - and see what happens.
2. Introduce Jigsaw modularization for the already existing Maven modules. We will follow a *Single Java module - Single Maven module* approach to keep things simple.
3. Leverage service providers to further decouple our new modules.
4. Split the implementation module further and talk a bit about plug-in architectures.
