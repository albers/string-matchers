# String Matchers
## A Journey from Java 8 to Java 9 modules

This repository contains a sample application that demonstrates how to refactor an existing multi-module Maven project from Java 8 to Java 9, while migrating to Jigsaw along the way.

The domain of the sample application is simple, so we can focus on the migration path. The application comprises two Maven modules, one module featuring the API for String matching algorithms as well as two implementations, and one module that implements a CLI to run text searches against those implementations.
